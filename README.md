# KasperTheGame
A small little game made during a halloween themed open house for children between the ages of 3 years to 7 years.

The Aurduino script above is what runs that game. 

There would be four LEDs and photoresitors in holes drilled in a verital board.

Each photoresitor would be paired with an LED in each hole.

The way the game would work is:
1. A random LED would light up.
2. The player would have to shine the flash light into the holes.
3. Game resets

The winning states is that the LED strips would light up.

I dont have any pictures of my project running, unfortunately.
